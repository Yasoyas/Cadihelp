<td><p>1F5 Hex (501 Dec) = Dynahyd A1 = Replace CRIPEV board.<br>
1F6 Hex (502 Dec) = Dynahyd A2 = Replace CRIPEV board.<br>
1F7 Hex (503 Dec) = Dynahyd A3 = Replace CRIPEV board.<br>
1F8 Hex (504 Dec) = Dynahyd A4 = Replace CRIPEV board.<br>
1F9 Hex (505 Dec) = Dynahyd A5 = No upwards start.  Check mainline for missing phase, blown fuse, or incorrect phase rotation. <br>
1FA Hex (506 Dec) = Dynahyd A6 = No upwards start due to softstarter UTS signal being on when it shouldn't be.  Softstarter "off delay" must be set to zero.<br>
1FB Hex (507 Dec) = Dynahyd C1 = No start due to the safety circuit being open.<br>
1FC Hex (508 Dec) = Dynahyd C2 = No upward start due to the CCR relay being on when it shouldn't.  Replace the CRIPEV board.<br>
1FD Hex (509 Dec) = Dynahyd C3 = No upward start due to CCR relay not picking when it should.  Replace the CRIPEV board.<br>
1FE Hex (510 Dec) = Dynahyd C5 = No upward start due to abnormal servo valve current. Check the servo valve and the wiring to it.  Replace the Servo Valve or the CRIPEV board.<br>
1FF Hex (511 Dec) = Dynahyd C7 = No downward start due to wrong operational mode.  Trying to make a trip while in "air bleed", "learn hydro" or "learn floor" mode.<br>
202 Hex (514 Dec) = Dynahyd E1 = Replace the CRIPEV print<br>
203 Hex (515 Dec) = Dynahyd E2 = Stopped during an upward travel due to the softstarter run command being off.  Replace the CRIPEV board.<br>
204 Hex (516 Dec) = Dynahyd E6 = Stop during up trip.  Check mainline for missing phase or blown fuse. <br>
206 Hex (518 Dec) = Dynahyd H7 = Stopped during an upward travel after overrunning the destination floor.  Check the encoder rope for slack.  Make a new “Learn Hydraulic Travel” with cold oil.  Replace servo valve.<br>
207 Hex (519 Dec) = Dynahyd H8 = Car moved while in air bleed mode (bypass).  Replace the servo valve.<br>
208 Hex (520 Dec) = Dynahyd R1 = Communication software timeout.<br>
226 Hex (550 Dec) = Dynahyd A9 = "Learn floor"  cannot be started.  The car must be level at the bottom floor (KLU, KLD, KSED all on).<br>
258 Hex (600 Dec) = Unable to send messages to the Dynahyd control.  Check that Dynahyd software chip is installed.  Replace CRIPEV.<br>
259 Hex (601 Dec) = Dynahyd D5 = Got an up command when the car was at the top floor.  May be ignored if on inspection, otherwise do a new "learn floor".<br>
25A Hex (602 Dec) = Dynahyd D6 = Got a down command when the car was at the bottom floor.  May be ignored if on inspection, otherwise do a new "learn floor".<br>
2BC Hex (700 Dec) = Dynahyd D4 = The floor was found more than 50mm from where it used to be.  Check for encoder slip.  Check to see if  KLU/KLD magnet has moved.<br>
2BD Hex (701 Dec) = Dynahyd P1 = The "learn floor" travel in the up direction failed because it did not see all the magnets properly.  Check magnets and try again.<br>
2BE Hex (702 Dec) = Dynahyd P2 = The "learn floor" travel in the down direction failed because it did not see all the magnets properly.  Check magnets and try again.<br>
320 Hex (800 Dec) = Dynahyd D3 = The learn floor travel in up direction failed because it did not see KSED magnet properly.  Check magnet and switch and try again.<br>
322 Hex (802 Dec) = Dynahyd U6 = The car stopped where the encoder says the floor is, but KLU and KLD are missing.  Check for missing floor magnet, check for encoder slip.</p></td>
