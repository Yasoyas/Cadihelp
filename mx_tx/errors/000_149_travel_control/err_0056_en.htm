<td valign="top"><h4>Description</h4></td>
<td><p>The trip monitoring detects that the car is still moving after the brake has closed. This may occur when the brake capability of the machine brake is insufficient.<br><br>
When finishing a trip (normal stop or emergency stop) the travel control deactivates the brake and waits for the brake to close. After the brake contacts indicate that the brakes have closed enough to switch both contacts the software checks the car speed periodically and expects the car to stop within the time limit defined by the internal parameter 'MOVE_SHUTDOWN' (default value: 4 sec). The condition that the car has stopped is that the car does not move more than 10mm within 1 sec (for a tacho factor of 3000inc/m). If the car still moves after the time defined by the parameter 'MOVE_SHUTDOWN' the error is generated and the control aborts the trip. This monitoring detects an unintended movement of the car at the end of a trip if the brake torque is insufficient or if the car keeps moving for another reason (monitoring of the car speed in standstill is done with 'overspeed' detection). This monitoring is also active during an emergency stop but only if mains power is available.</p></td>
