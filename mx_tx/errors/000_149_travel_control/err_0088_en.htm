<td valign="top"><h4>Description</h4></td>
<td><p>Major problem with the car position tacho. The position value read from the position tacho (for incremental or absolute encoders) is inconsistent. The value representing the car position either jumped (difference between values too big) or no tacho impulses were detected during the trip.</p></td>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><h4>Extra Info</h4></td>
<td><p>0 (hex)/0 (dec): No signal (speed feedback) from position tacho when starting a trip while speed reference below the limit for underspeed error. This monitoring is disabled with active JMOF or when finishing a trip.<br><br>
1 (hex)/1 (dec): During INSPECTION or RECALL trip the car is allowed to move for a distance of 0.5m with a faulty car position tacho (S_TACHO). After a distance of 0.5m running with V_TACHO (speed feedback from inverter) the control stops the car with error TACHO_FAULT.<br><br>
A (hex)/10 (dec): The position value read from the position tacho is not in the shaft range. (Absolute encoder was disconnected during manual trip.)<br><br>
B (hex)/11 (dec): same as extra info value A(hex)<br><br>
C (hex)/12 (dec): The position value read from the position tacho is not in the shaft range. (Absolute encoder was disconnected during inspection trip in up direction.)<br><br>
D (hex)/13 (dec): same as extra info value C(hex)<br><br>
E (hex)/14 (dec): The position value read from the position tacho is not in the shaft range. (Absolute encoder was disconnected during inspection trip in down direction.)<br><br>
F (hex)/15 (dec): The position value read from the position tacho is not in the shaft range. An inspection trip in up direction was initiated with the tacho disconnected or with the elevator out of the shaft range.<br><br>
10(hex)/16 (dec): The position value read from the position tacho is not in the shaft range. An inspection trip in down direction was initiated with the tacho disconnected or with the elevator out of the shaft range<br><br>
