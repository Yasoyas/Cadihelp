<td><p>The errors occurs if the control cannot perform the battery test because the battery is being charged. After that the control attempts to check the battery every 5min. The battery charging is done automatically by the hardware. Refer also to error message 'Battery Charge Time Expired'.<br><br>
Remark: This event is normal following a power failure. If the battery requires increasingly charging, the battery should be checked to see if it is OK, and replaced if necessary. Normally, the battery level is tested at every reset and once an hour there after, however if the battery is charging then the reserve level of the battery is not tested since the battery needs charging anyway.</p></td>
