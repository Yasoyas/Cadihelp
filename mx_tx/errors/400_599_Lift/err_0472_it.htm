<td valign="top"><h4>Description</h4></td>
<td><p>Software Warning "VCOM_queue_full".  A software-task received too many messages in a short period of time, or is not responding.<br><br>
IMPORTANT!<br>
If the error keeps appearing during normal operation reliable operation is no longer guaranteed. Immediately save the error log and note the circumstances under which the error occurred. Contact the help desk or the hotline of the supplier.<br><br>
The error indicates that internal messages may be lost; some services or I/O may get stuck; eventually a reset on the lift control may be necessary to restore normal operation.<br>
This error is reported in 2 stages. The difference can be identified by the Extra Info:<br><br>
OV_MOD_WARNING:	This indicates a brief period of extreme stress has activated the "OV-MOD" protection mechanism. No messages are lost, but the system is in a dangerous condition. If the extreme stress persists message will finally be lost. (This serves as a warning that to adjust the size of the queue concerned.)<br><br>
VCOM_QUEUE_FULL: This error normally appears after the OV-MOD warning. The protection mechanism has reached its limits and messages are now being lost.<br><br>
Note that this error is reported in the log only for the first overflow of a particular queue for a period of several seconds; subsequent overflows are not reported in order to prevent further bus stress on the system.</p></td>
